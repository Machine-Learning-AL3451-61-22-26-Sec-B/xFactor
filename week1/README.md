Concept Learning Algorithm using "CANDIDATE ELIMINATION ALGORITHM"

This Python script implements a basic version of the concept learning algorithm using the Candidate Elimination algorithm. It takes a dataset in CSV format, where each row represents an instance of a concept, and the last column represents the target concept (either "yes" or "no"). The algorithm then generates the most specific and general hypotheses based on the provided data.
