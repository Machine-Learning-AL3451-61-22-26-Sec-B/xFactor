"CANDIDATE ELIMINATION ALGORITHM"

Introduction:
This Python script implements a basic version of the concept learning algorithm using the Candidate Elimination algorithm. It takes a dataset in CSV format, where each row represents an instance of a concept, and the last column represents the target concept (either "yes" or "no"). The algorithm then generates the most specific and general hypotheses based on the provided data.

Requirements:
To run the Python code, make sure Python is installed and import the required libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Streamlit

Algorithm Steps:
Initialize the specific hypothesis with the first instance in the dataset.
Initialize the general hypothesis with all attributes set to "?".
Iterate through each instance in the dataset:
If the target concept is "yes", update the specific and general hypotheses accordingly.
If the target concept is "no", update the general hypothesis accordingly.
Remove any redundant hypotheses from the final general hypothesis.
