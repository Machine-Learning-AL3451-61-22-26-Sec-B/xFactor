# Decision Tree Classifier with Streamlit

## Overview

This Streamlit application implements a Decision Tree Classifier using the ID3 algorithm for machine learning tasks. It allows users to upload their own dataset in CSV format, preprocess the data, train a decision tree model, visualize the decision tree, and make predictions.

The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning.

## Features

- **Dataset Upload**: Users can upload their own dataset in CSV format.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The uploaded dataset is preprocessed using label encoding.
- **Training**: The decision tree model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the trained decision tree.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions based on user-input feature values.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's accuracy on a test dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/decision-tree-classifier.git
