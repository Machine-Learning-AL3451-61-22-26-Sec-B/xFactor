# Neural Network with Backpropagation Algorithm using Streamlit

This Streamlit application demonstrates a simple neural network trained using the backpropagation algorithm. The neural network is implemented to predict outputs based on given inputs. Users can configure the training settings and observe the model's performance.

## Description

This application implements a neural network with a configurable number of epochs and learning rate. The neural network is trained on a sample dataset to predict outputs corresponding to input features using the backpropagation algorithm. Users can interact with the application to observe the network's predictions.

## Features

- Allows users to configure the number of training epochs and learning rate.
- Displays the normalized input data, actual output data, and predicted output after training.
- Implements a basic neural network with a customizable architecture.
