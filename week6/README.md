# Bayesian Network for COVID-19 Symptom Classification

## Introduction
This application uses a Bayesian Network to classify COVID-19 symptoms based on the provided dataset.

## Synthetic Dataset Creation
A synthetic dataset is generated to simulate COVID-19 symptom data.

## Dataset Overview
### First Five Rows of the Dataset
The first five rows of the synthetic dataset are displayed.

### Dataset Description
Summary statistics of the synthetic dataset are provided.

### Missing Values
The presence of missing values in the dataset is checked and displayed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Histograms
Histograms for numeric columns in the dataset are displayed to visualize the distribution of each feature.

## Bayesian Network
### Structure
The Bayesian Network structure is defined based on the relationship between symptoms and the target variable.

### Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs)
The Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) for each node in the Bayesian Network are displayed.

## Inference
### Variable Elimination
Variable Elimination is performed for inference. Users can select their symptoms, and the application provides the probability of having COVID-19 given the symptoms.

## Usage
To use the application, users can interact with the interface to select their symptoms and obtain the probability of having COVID-19.
